# Ground rules

Copied verbatim from docs/particl-sow.md, section 3. The scope of work is the source of truth; read it in full before touching code, and update it when a change makes it wrong (SOW §13.4).

1. **Other people's money.** Every render bills a customer workspace in credits they paid for. Never trigger a generation, training run or upscale against a customer workspace. Development uses mocked engine responses; if a test needs a real call it runs in a dedicated internal workspace, and you state the cost and wait for a yes.
2. **Tenant isolation is the floor.** Every table carries `workspace_id`; every query filters on it; every Blob path is prefixed by it; every signed URL is scoped to it. Identities, cast, masters, prompts, costs and rules never cross a boundary. If you can't point at where a query is scoped, it's a bug.
3. **Nothing tied to one studio in the code.** Rules, defaults and the camera bank become the **platform layer** — inherited by every workspace, overridable by each. No workspace, client or person names in source, seed data or copy.
4. **Don't redesign what works.** Shot/take, draft → picked → approved, cost-on-the-button, Setup carried into every shot, `@cast`, file naming, caps. Extend; don't replace.
5. **One vocabulary.** Enforced in code, decided once. Current state on particl.app is close: Takes / Productions / Generate. Remaining drift: the dock says `GENERATE` while the segmented control says Video / Images / Audio.
6. **Five minutes.** A stranger with an invite gets from email to first render in five minutes without reading a paragraph. Every screen is judged against that person.
7. **Two first-class surfaces, different jobs.** Desktop is where work is made: composing, wiring Rig, reviewing at speed, bulk actions, admin. Mobile is where work is judged: watch a run, compare, approve, unlock a cap. Neither is a shrunken version of the other. Every change ships with Playwright checks at 360×640, 390×844, 844×390, 1440×900 and 1920×1080. No horizontal overflow at any width; primary actions reachable without panning; dock and sheets clear of the home indicator; no fixed-width layout stranding whitespace above 1600px.
8. **Small PRs**, one concern each, in phase order.
9. **Prose in the product is a cost.** The copy voice is good; there's too much of it. Where a paragraph explains what the UI should make obvious, fix the UI and cut the paragraph.
